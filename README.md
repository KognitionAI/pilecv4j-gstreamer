## What is this project?

This is the deprecated [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) based functionality previously part of [pilecv4j](https://github.com/KognitionAI/pilecv4j). All of this functionality is now better implemented on top of [FFMpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) in pilecv4j's lib-ffmpeg.
